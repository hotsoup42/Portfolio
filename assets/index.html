          Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to
          the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more
          shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one

          giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you
          in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money
          is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there,
          and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

          Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how
          you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're
          friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They
          called me Mr Glass.
